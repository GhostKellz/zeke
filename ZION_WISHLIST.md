## üõ†Ô∏è Integration Example

**Current Limitation**: CLI-only interaction
```bash
# What we have to do now (clunky)
zion add httpz
zeke ask "analyze my dependencies"
```

**Desired Integration**: Seamless AI assistance
```bash
# What we want (seamless)
zion ghostwriter "I need a fast HTTP client"
# ‚Üí AI analyzes project, suggests httpz, explains why, asks to install

zion ghostwriter "my build is slow"  
# ‚Üí AI analyzes build.zig, suggests optimizations, offers to apply them
```
