# 🚀 Zeke Revolutionary Roadmap

## TL;DR - What Makes Zeke Different

**The Winning Combination:**
```
Native Zig Speed (10-100x faster than Python)
    + Grove AST (precise, not regex)
    + Rune MCP (universal AI backend)
    + Zap Smart Git (learns from you)
    + Ghostlang (native-speed plugins)
    + Hybrid AI (local + cloud routing)
    = REVOLUTIONARY
```

**Nobody else has this.**

## 🎯 The ONE Feature to Build First

### **Zeke Watch Mode** (The Killer Feature)

```bash
zeke watch --auto-fix --auto-commit

⚡ Watching /data/projects/myapp
📝 Parsed 47 files with Grove
✅ All green

[You code...]

🔍 src/api.zig changed
📊 Grove analysis: ⚠️  Unused variable 'result' @ line 42
✅ Auto-fixed
🧪 Tests passed
📝 Zap commit: "refactor(api): Remove unused variable"
```

**Why this wins:**
1. ✅ **Immediate value** - Magic happens in 30 seconds
2. ✅ **Uses entire GhostStack** - Grove, Zap, Ollama working together
3. ✅ **No competition** - Nobody has this UX
4. ✅ **Easy demo** - One command = instant wow factor
5. ✅ **Natural workflow** - You code, Zeke assists automatically

## 📊 Gap Analysis vs Competitors

### What Zeke is Missing

**vs Claude Code:**
- ❌ Tool execution framework
- ❌ Autonomous agent loops
- ❌ Safety/approval system
- ❌ Token budget tracking

**vs Cursor:**
- ❌ Real-time inline suggestions
- ❌ Multi-file atomic edits
- ❌ Diff preview before apply
- ❌ @-mentions for context

**vs Aider:**
- ❌ Repository map generation
- ❌ Undo system for AI edits
- ❌ Architect mode (plan → execute)

### What Zeke Has That They Don't

**✅ GhostStack Ecosystem:**
- Native Zig performance
- Grove AST-accurate parsing
- Rune MCP server capability
- Zap commit intelligence
- Ghostlang native plugins

**✅ Hybrid Intelligence:**
- Local Ollama + Cloud AI routing
- Privacy-first mode (per-repo config)
- Cost optimization

**✅ Learning System:**
- Zap learns from commit history
- Team pattern recognition
- Workflow optimization

## 🏗️ Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Must Have)

**1. MCP Server Mode**
```bash
zeke --mcp-server
# → Exposes Zeke as MCP server
# → Claude Desktop, GPT, etc. can use Zeke
# → FIRST native Zig MCP server for dev tools
```

**2. Context Building**
```zig
// Auto-track recent files
// Build Grove dependency graph
// Include relevant symbols in prompts
```

**3. Tool Execution Framework**
```zig
pub const Tool = struct {
    name: []const u8,
    execute: fn(ctx: *ToolCtx) !Result,
    needs_approval: bool,
};
```

**4. Grove Refactoring**
```bash
zeke refactor rename old_name new_name
# → AST-accurate, not regex
# → Handles scope correctly
# → Updates all references
```

**5. Zeke Watch Mode** ⭐ **KILLER FEATURE**
```bash
zeke watch [options]
# → File watcher + Grove parser
# → Auto-detect issues
# → Suggest/apply fixes
# → Auto-commit when tests pass
```

---

### Phase 2: Revolutionary Features

**6. Time-Travel Development**
```bash
zeke snapshot create "Before AI refactor"
zeke snapshot list
zeke snapshot restore <id>

# Semantic undo:
zeke undo "last AI refactor"
zeke undo function add  # Undo changes to specific symbol
```

**7. Smart AI Routing**
```zig
// Auto-route based on:
// - Task complexity
// - Privacy settings (.zeke/privacy.json)
// - Cost budget
// - Performance needs

// Simple tasks → Ollama (fast, free, local)
// Complex tasks → Claude (quality, cloud)
```

**8. Repository Map**
```bash
zeke map generate
# → Grove builds semantic code map
# → Caches in .zeke/map.json
# → Updates incrementally
# → Used for context in AI requests
```

**9. Ghostlang Plugin System**
```bash
~/.zeke/plugins/
├── commit-hook.gza
├── test-generator.gza
└── code-reviewer.gza

# Auto-loaded on startup
# Native Zig performance
# Team-shareable via repo
```

---

### Phase 3: Competitive Differentiation

**10. Multi-file Atomic Edits**
```bash
zeke edit --multi "Add error handling to all API routes"
# → Preview changes with AST diff
# → Approve/reject
# → Apply atomically (all or nothing)
```

**11. Ensemble Mode** (Unique!)
```bash
zeke ask --ensemble "Should I use async here?"

# Asks Ollama + Claude + GPT
# Shows all answers
# Highlights consensus
# You choose best
```

**12. Error-Driven Development**
```bash
zeke fix-until-compiles

# Loop:
# 1. Run build
# 2. Capture errors
# 3. AI fixes errors
# 4. Goto 1 until success
```

**13. Team Collaboration**
```bash
# Team-wide Ghostlang plugins
.zeke/plugins/team/
├── our-commit-style.gza
├── security-checks.gza
└── test-standards.gza

# Zap learns from whole team's commits
# Suggests team conventions, not generic
```
