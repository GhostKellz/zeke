:# ZEKE Development TODO - Weekend Tasks

## ðŸš€ High Priority Features
  - Core Functionality: The main CLI tool that needs file ops, git integration, search
  - Feature Parity: This is where you close the gap with Claude Code CLI
  - Stable Foundation: Build on improved GhostLLM performance

  Critical work (from earlier analysis):
  - File system operations (read, write, edit, search)
  - Git integration (status, diff, commit, PR management)
  - Project navigation and context understanding
  - Build system integration
