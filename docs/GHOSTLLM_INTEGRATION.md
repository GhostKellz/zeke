# GhostLLM Integration Plan

## Overview
GhostLLM is being developed as a separate Rust-based service that will integrate with Zeke to provide enhanced AI capabilities.

## Current Status
- âœ… API interface defined in `src/api/client.zig`
- âœ… Provider enum includes `ghostllm`
- âœ… Stub implementations provide mock responses
- ðŸš§ Rust service in development

## Integration Architecture

### Communication
- **HTTP API**: GhostLLM will expose REST endpoints
- **IPC Option**: Future socket/pipe communication for local instances
- **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication (stubbed)

### Endpoints (Planned)
- `/v1/zeke/code/analyze` - Code analysis with AI
- `/v1/zeke/code/explain` - Code explanation
- `/v1/zeke/code/refactor` - Code refactoring suggestions
- `/v1/zeke/code/test` - Test generation
- `/v1/zeke/project/context` - Project analysis
- `/v1/zeke/git/commit` - Commit message generation
- `/v1/zeke/security/scan` - Security analysis

### Current Stub Behavior
All GhostLLM methods currently return mock responses that demonstrate the expected functionality. This allows Zeke to be fully functional while the Rust service is under development.

## Future Implementation
Once the Rust GhostLLM service is ready:
1. Update base URL configuration
2. Remove mock response logic
3. Add proper error handling for service connectivity
4. Implement authentication flow
5. Add health checking and fallback mechanisms

## Development Notes
- Stub implementations in `src/api/client.zig` lines 194-560
- Provider routing includes ghostllm fallback to local auth
- All response types are defined and ready for integration
