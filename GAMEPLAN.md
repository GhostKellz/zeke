  Ollama Integration

  ‚úÖ Well Integrated - Ollama is fully supported as a provider with:
  - Default endpoint: http://localhost:11434
  - No auth required (local instance)
  - Fallback provider for other services
  - Part of provider routing system

  GhostLLM Integration

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented - GhostLLM has comprehensive integration but mostly mock 
  implementations:
  - Full client implementation with GPU stats, benchmarking, streaming
  - Smart contract analysis capabilities
  - QUIC/HTTP3 support planned
  - Issue: Most methods are mocked/simulated, not real

  üöÄ Project Recommendations for New Features & Polish

  1. GhostLLM - Highest Priority ü•á

  Why: Most technically advanced, GPU-focused, unique positioning
  New Features Needed:
  - Real Docker/Ollama Model Detection: Connect to your Docker ollama instance
  - Live GPU Monitoring Dashboard: Web GUI showing real-time GPU stats
  - Multi-Model Serving: Serve multiple models simultaneously
  - Performance Benchmarking Suite: Real benchmark tools vs mocked ones

  2. Zeke - Strong Second ü•à

  Why: Already functional, good foundation, immediate utility
  New Features Needed:
  - Docker Ollama Auto-Discovery: Detect and connect to your Docker ollama models
  - Real-time Model Switching: Hot-swap between local/remote models
  - Web GUI Dashboard: Monitor all providers, conversations, performance
  - Advanced Context Management: Better conversation persistence

  3. GhostFlow - Emerging Potential ü•â

  Why: Modern architecture, good positioning vs n8n
  New Features Needed:
  - AI Model Node Library: Pre-built nodes for common AI tasks
  - Ollama Integration Nodes: Direct integration with your Docker setup
  - Template Marketplace: Ready-made AI workflow templates
  - Real-time Monitoring: Live workflow execution dashboard

  4. Jarvis - Long-term Play üîß

  Why: Early stage, needs more foundation work
  Polish Needed:
  - Core plugin system completion
  - Better CLI UX/commands
  - Local LLM integration standardiza
